# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

To establish a connection between the local and the github repository you will first need to fork the github repository if you don't have the ownership of it. If it is being made from scratch, skip this step. Find the SSH key in github, and copy it and the correspoing commands. int he terminal use ``git clone [insert ssh key here]`` to clone the repository to the local machine.
